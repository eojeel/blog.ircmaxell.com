Today, I'm doing a talk atÂ [PHP Benelux 13](http://conference.phpbenelux.eu/2013/) on Password Storage and Attacking in PHP. Here are the slides for that talk, as well as the accompanying GitHub repo that I use throughout the talk. When the videos are posted, I'll make a followup post that links to it. Without rambling on further, click through for the links!
