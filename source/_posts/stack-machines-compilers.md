I have the honor today of writing a guest blog post on [Igor Wiedler's Blog about Compilers](https://igor.io/2014/12/18/stack-machines-compilers.html). If you don't know [@igorwhiletrue](https://twitter.com/igorwhiletrue), he's pretty much the craziest developer that I know. And crazy in that genious sort of way. He's been doing a series of blog posts about [Stack Machines](https://igor.io/2013/08/28/stack-machines-fundamentals.html) and building complex runtimes from simple components. Well, today I authored a guest post on compiling code to run on said runtime. The compiler only took about 100 lines of code!!!
