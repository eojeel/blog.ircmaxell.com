Time for some more shameless self-promotion...  I'll be doing a [talk at the New York PHP group](http://www.nyphp.org/php-presentations/199_Dont-be-STUPID-GRASP-SOLID) on Tuesday May 22, 2012. I'll be discussing some Object Oriented design principles and how to apply them to your projects. We'll specifically discuss the[ STUPID and SOLID](http://nikic.github.com/2011/12/27/Dont-be-STUPID-GRASP-SOLID.html) principles. Here's the full abstract:

> When it comes to Object Oriented Programming, there is no shortage of guidelines and principles for how to properly design an OO system. There is also no shortage of acronyms to describe these principles: DRY, SRP, LSP, LoD, ISP, OCP, etc. However, there are two acronyms that really shine through to describe how to, and how not to do OOP well. The two acronyms are SOLID and STUPID (respectively). We'll discuss some of the underlying principles of Object Oriented Programming, and how we can learn from the principles identified by each of these two acronyms. Additionally, we'll explore some additional anti-patterns of Object Oriented Design and how they can be avoided. Finally, we'll talk about how all of this applies to our every day development tasks, and the real-world benefit these design principles provide...
