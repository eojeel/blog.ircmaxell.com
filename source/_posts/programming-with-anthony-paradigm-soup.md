So, for the past few days I've been talking about a *secret project* that I've been working on. Well, today I'm pleased to announce the project. I've been working on starting a series of YouTube videos about programming. The first of these videos is about Paradigms (Procedural, OOP, Functional). Plenty of future ones are planned, but the topics, order and even if they happen is completely up to you! I want your feedback on the concept. Is it something worth pursuing? Any topics you'd like to see? Any other comments about the concept? You can reply to this post, or to the video itself. So, without further adue, here's the video:
