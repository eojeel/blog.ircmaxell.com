Hello all.  It's been a little while since my last post, but I haven't disappeared.  In fact, I've been quite busy...


<!--more-->
So, in the past month I have started a new job.  I am now working for NBC Universal as a senior PHP developer.  It's been quite an interesting month getting up to speed and taking on my first projects.  The team they already have there is great, and I hope to become a strong part of it.  As time goes on, I'll try to post more on what's going on there and what I've learned.


But now, to the reason for this post.  If you weren't aware, I've spoken 3 times in the past 2 weeks on SQL Injection with PHP.  Once at NYPHP, once at OWASP NJ and once at UNIGroup NYC.  All three went off great!  Unfortunately due to technical reasons, we weren't able to get recordings of any of the talks.  But I'm linking the slides from all three presentations here.


If there's enough interest, I can do a webcast of the talk and put it online.  I hope future talks will be either streamed, or recorded.


Here are the slides in PDF format:
