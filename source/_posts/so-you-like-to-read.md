One of the things that I see repeated over and over again is the simple question "*What books should I read to become a better developer?*". Or "*How did you learn about that?*". Or even *"What does a coding standard matter?"*... OK, so that last one was a bit of a sentinel question, but the point is clear. Where should you look if you want to read to improve your development abilities? Well, I figured I'd take a few pages out of my library and share which books worked for me, in order of significance. If you remember from [a prior pos](http://blog.ircmaxell.com/2011/11/becoming-better-developer.html)t, I indicated that you should choose concepts over implementations. This list should illustrate that.<!--more-->
## Code Complete 2 - Steve McConnell

[![](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nWkLCu1SL._SS500_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670/)

To be completely honest, this book changed the way that I write code. Not only did it change how I write code, but it changed my whole approach to code. Before reading this book, I wrote code to solve a problem. Reading code? Who'd need to do that? After this book, I really started focusing more on writing clean, readable code. It was so well presented, that I actually read this in a long weekend.

I still keep it on my desk at work for those times I need to reference a figure, or demonstrate to others the statistics behind why something is (or is not) a good idea. It's proved an invaluable book in my library.

This is a must for anyone who considers themselves to be a professional developer.## Gödel Escher Bach - Douglas Hofstadter

This book didn't change how I write code. It changed how I solved problems. But it did more than that. It really changed how I looked at the world. It taught me about the power of symbols and abstractions.

I HIGHLY recommend reading this book. It has a bit of math in it, but the book doesn't loose much value if you don't understand that math. He does a very good job explaining the concepts and not just the details.

## The Clean Coder - Robert C. Martin

This is another book that I value dearly. Oddly enough, it's not really about code. It's a code of conduct for professional developers. It really changed the way that I interact with business stakeholders.

It's a very good read, and an absolute must for anyone who develops professionally. If even for the part about managing expectations, it's worth it.

## The Rest Of The List


Those three books are musts for every single professional developer (In my opinion at least). The rest here are a few selections from my library that I'd recommend highly (in no particular order). * **[Clean Code](http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/) - Robert C. Martin** - Another great book, similar in content to Code Complete 2, but from a different angle. 
 * **[Patterns Of Enterprise Application Architecture](http://www.amazon.com/Patterns-Enterprise-Application-Architecture-Martin/dp/0321127420/) - Martin Fowler** - A bible for object oriented design and application structure.
 * **[SQL Antipatterns](http://www.amazon.com/SQL-Antipatterns-Programming-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/1934356557/) - Bill Karwin** - A must-read for any developer who deals with database design and architecture.
 * **[Working Effectively with Legacy Code](http://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052/) - Michael Feathers** - A good read for anyone who maintains or works with a legacy codebase.
 * **[Test Driven Development](http://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Kent-Beck/dp/0321146530/) - Kent Beck** - A very easy to follow introduction into TDD.
 * **[Driving Technical Change](http://www.amazon.com/Driving-Technical-Change-Terrence-Ryan/dp/1934356603/) - Terrence Ryan** - A great book about working with teams and getting ideas past people who don't want to change.<
 * **[97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know](http://www.amazon.com/Things-Every-Project-Manager-Should/dp/0596804164/) - Various** - Yes, this is a book about project management. But it's loaded with good information that every developer should know as well. It's really a great read.
 * **[Being Geek](http://www.amazon.com/Being-Geek-Software-Developers-Handbook/dp/0596155409/) - Michael Lopp** - A really good book for thinking about programming as a career and not just a job.

Note that there's not a single PHP specific book in that list. That gets back to my belief that I shared earlier that you should focus on concepts instead of implementations. That's not to say that there aren't good PHP books out there (I'm sure there are), just that I prefer to stay language agnostic when it comes to what I read...
