Part 2 of the PHP's Source Code for PHP Developers series is up over on [Nikic's Blog](http://nikic.github.com/2012/03/16/Understanding-PHPs-internal-function-definitions.html).  In it, he discusses how internal PHP functions are defined, and how to figure out what they do.  Part 3 will be back over here and will cover how variables work internally (The `ZVAL`).  Enjoy!
