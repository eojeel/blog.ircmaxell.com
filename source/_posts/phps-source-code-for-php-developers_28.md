Part 4 of the PHP's Source Code for PHP Developers series is up over on [Nikic's Blog](http://nikic.github.com/2012/03/28/Understanding-PHPs-internal-array-implementation.html).  In it, he discusses how arrays are handled in PHP internals.  He talks a lot about hash tables and symbol tables, and how they work together to make PHP a working language.  Part 5 will be back over here, and we'll talk about objects and classes!  Enjoy!
